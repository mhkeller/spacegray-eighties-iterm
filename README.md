===

To install:

* Launch iTerm 2.
* Type cmd+i
* Navigate to `Colors` tab
* Click on `Load Presets`
* Click on `Import`
* Select the .itermcolors file you'd like to use
* Click on `Load Presets` and choose the scheme you just loaded
* Navigate to the `General` tab and click `Copy Preferences to Profile`

This is still a work in progress, not all colors are super pretty.
