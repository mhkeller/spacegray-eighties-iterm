Spacegray Eighties for iTerm2
===

This will match your iTerm2 theme to the [Spacegray Eighties](http://github.com/mhkeller/spacegray) Sublime theme.

It contains two versions

##### Spacegray eighties

This will match the theme exactly.

##### Spacegray eighties dull

There's also a slightly dulled version, which is what I use.
