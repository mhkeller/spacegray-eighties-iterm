Spacegray Eighties for iTerm2
===

This will match your iTerm2 theme to the [Spacegray Eighties](http://github.com/kkga/spacegray) Sublime theme.

It contains two versions

##### Spacegray eighties

This will match the theme exactly.

##### Spacegray eighties dull

If you find that to be a little too bright, this version is a little dulled. I find it preferable.
